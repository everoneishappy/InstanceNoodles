~wip~ Modular patching system for Compute &  Geometry shaders in DX11/vvvv
I'm very new to HLSL still, there will be bugs!  Substantial amounts of code borrowed from Vux, UNC, Microdee et al.  If there is something that should be credited that's not please just let me know.
Made with VVVV x64 33.7, but should work with newer versions.
Requires VVVV + Addon & DX11 packs, and a gpu that supports Shader Model 5.
This is an alpha Version, can expect some breaking changes.
